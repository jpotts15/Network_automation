# Network_automation
This repo will house various network automation scripts, playbooks, etc

I have a habit of learning new things, doing it once then moving on and forgetting and misplacing things so the intent with this repo is to help me store for network automation related scripts, playbooks, etc for later use. 

Goal

1. Build out a simple EVE-NG lab
2. Build simple boot strap type configs to gain reachability to virtual devices 
3. Use python with various modules to configure several devices
4. Use Ansible using various playbooks/methods to configure several different devices
